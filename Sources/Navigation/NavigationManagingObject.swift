/// `NavigationManagingObject` defines a protocol for objects that manage navigation within a SwiftUI application.
/// It specifies a set of navigation operations that enable type-safe routing between views identified by destinations conforming to the `Navigable` protocol.
/// Implementers of this protocol can control navigation stacks, allowing for forward and backward navigation, programmatically navigating to specific destinations, and modifying the navigation stack as needed.
///
/// Types implementing `NavigationManagingObject` can serve as the backbone of a navigation system, providing a consistent interface for navigating through an app's screens or views.

    /// Modifying this stack updates the navigation state of the application.
    var stack: [Destination] { get set }

    /// Navigate back in the navigation stack by a specified number of destinations.
    ///
    /// - Parameter count: The number of destinations to navigate back by.
    /// If the count exceeds the number of destinations in the stack, the stack is emptied.
    func navigateBack(_ count: Int)

    /// Navigate back to a specific destination in the stack, removing all destinations that come after it.
    ///
    /// - Parameter destination: The destination to navigate back to.
    /// If the destination does not exist in the stack, no action is taken.
    func navigateBack(to destination: Destination)

    /// Resets the navigation stack to its initial state, effectively navigating to the root destination.

    /// - Parameter destination: The destination to navigate to.
